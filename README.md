# ehouse-test

1. workflow:
    - first I downloaded the down zip and uploaded it to git in a new repo, so i can connect it to shopify and keep a version controlling environment.
    - given that it is a test I did not create a specific branch for this development

## Starting from top tp bottom

    - start working in the nav, I used section.settings.menu.links to let the merchant set its own menu in the editor created in the navigation inside the admin (all links are redirecting to all collections, but are easily set from the admin => navigation)
